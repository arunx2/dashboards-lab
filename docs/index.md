# Querying data with OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch Dashboards is a forked version of Apache V2 licenced Kibana 7.10.2. It is a visualization
engine to view and query data. It internally generates OpenSearch native DSL queries for your
visualizations. However, there are other options to query and view your data in the Dashboards.

1. [DQL (Dashboards Query Language)](./dql.md)
2. [Lucene queries](./lucene.md)
3. [PPL (Piped Processing Language)](ppl.md)
4. SQL (Structured Query Language)

Before we begin, lets load some data to OpenSearch Dashboards. In the `Home` page, click on `Add Sample Data`
and click on `Add Data` to all three available sample data.
